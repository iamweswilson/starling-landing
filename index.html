                        StarlingX is open source software that provides cloud infrastructure for the most demanding applications in edge, industrial IOT, and telecom use cases. It is based on code contributed by Intel and Wind River and combines components of its own with leading open source projects such as OpenStack, Ceph and OVS.

                    <p>
                        Based on five generations of production software, this seed code will be the base for future fully open source implementations that can be productized.  In addition to standard cloud functionality, the project components provide fault management and service management amongst others to ensure high availability of user applications.

                        The code is available under the Apache 2 license.
