                        StarlingX is open source software that provides cloud infrastructure for the most demanding applications in edge, industrial IOT, and telecom use cases. By combining StarlingX components and leading open source projects such as OpenStack, Ceph and OVS into an integrated and tested stack, it provides a resilient environment for virtualized workloads on carrier and critical infrastructure networks.

                        Based on five generations of development and real-world usage, the software is battle tested and ready for production. In addition to standard cloud functionality, the project components provide fault management and service management to ensure high availability of user applications.
